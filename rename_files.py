# Renames all files in a folder with sequential serial numbers (padded with zeros).

# Inputs: Path to the folder containing files to rename.
# Iterates through all files in the folder.
# Extracts the original file extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg).
# Constructs a new filename with a 3-digit serial number (padded with zeros) followed by the extension.
# Creates full paths for the original and new filenames.
# Attempts to rename the file using os.rename.
# Increments the counter for the next file.
# Handles potential errors if a file with the new name already exists.
